### Component Design
- **Reusability:** Design components to be reusable across different parts of the application. Use props to pass dynamic data instead of hardcoding values.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component should have a single responsibility, making them easier to test and maintain.
- **Presentational vs. Container Components:**
  - **Presentational Components:** Focus on the UI and how things look. They receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.
  - **Container Components:** Focus on functionality and how things work. They handle data fetching and state management, passing data down to presentational components as needed.

### State Management
- **Local State:** Use React’s `useState` and `useReducer` hooks for managing local component state.
- **Global State:** Implement React Context API for managing global state related to user authentication and invoice data when necessary. Avoid overcomplicating with Redux unless the application scales significantly.

## UI/UX Design

### User Interface
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language across all components and pages by utilizing Bootstrap’s predefined classes and components.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the application is accessible by following accessibility best practices, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and functions well on various devices and screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system and responsive utilities.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to users during interactions, such as loading indicators, success messages, and error notifications.

### Form Handling
- **Formik:** Use Formik for building and managing forms, handling form state, and simplifying form submission processes.
- **Yup:** Implement Yup for schema-based form validation to ensure robust client-side validation.
- **Validation:** Perform both client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity.

## API Integration

### Communication
- **Axios:** Use Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend APIs. Configure Axios instances with base URLs for simplicity.
- **Supabase Client:** Utilize the Supabase client for interacting with Supabase services such as authentication and storage.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for API calls, displaying user-friendly error messages when requests fail.
- **Authentication:** Handle authentication tokens securely by leveraging Supabase Auth’s session management and storing tokens in secure storage to prevent XSS attacks.

### Security
- **HTTPS:** Ensure all API calls are made over HTTPS to secure data transmission.
- **Token Management:** Securely manage authentication tokens using Supabase’s built-in session management, refreshing them as needed.
- **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

## Performance Optimization

### Code Splitting
- **Dynamic Imports:** Use Next.js dynamic imports to split code and load components only when needed, reducing initial load times.

### Caching
- **API Responses:** Implement basic caching strategies for API responses where applicable to reduce redundant network requests.
- **Supabase Caching:** Leverage Supabase’s built-in caching mechanisms where available to optimize data fetching.
- **Static Assets:** Serve static assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to accelerate load times.

### Image Optimization
- **Next/Image:** Utilize Next.js Image component for optimized image loading and handling, including automatic resizing and format selection.

### Efficient Supabase Interactions
- **Batch Requests:** Where possible, batch multiple Supabase requests to reduce the number of network calls.
- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for data-heavy requests to improve performance and user experience.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Framework:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for writing and running unit tests.
- **Coverage:** Aim for good test coverage, particularly for critical UI components and utility functions.
- **Mocking:** Utilize mocking for external dependencies and API calls to isolate components during testing.

### End-to-End Testing
- **Cypress:** Implement basic end-to-end tests using Cypress to simulate key user interactions and verify application workflows.

### Continuous Integration
- **CI Pipeline:** Integrate tests into the CI pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions to ensure tests run automatically on code commits and pull requests.
- **Reporting:** Configure test result reporting to provide clear feedback on test outcomes.

## Deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- **Vercel:** Deploy the frontend using Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js, offering features like automatic deployments and CDN support.
- **Alternative:** If preferred, deploy on AWS S3 with CloudFront for efficient static asset serving.

### Environment Variables
- **Configuration:** Manage environment variables securely using `.env` files and Next.js environment variable management. Ensure sensitive information is not exposed in the frontend codebase.
- **Supabase Variables:** Include Supabase-specific environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) in your `.env` files.
- **Variable Prefixing:** Prefix environment variables that need to be exposed to the browser with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to differentiate them from server-only variables.

## Maintenance

### Documentation
- **Component Documentation:** Keep component documentation up-to-date, detailing component purpose and usage.
- **Technical Docs:** Maintain concise internal documentation for frontend services and utilities to facilitate onboarding and future development.
- **Change Logs:** Maintain a changelog to track significant changes and updates to the frontend codebase.

### Static Analysis
- **Linters:** Use ESLint to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues early in the development process.
- **Formatters:** Utilize Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- **Type Checking:** Leverage TypeScript’s type checking capabilities to catch type-related errors during development.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data:** Avoid storing sensitive data on the client-side. Use secure storage mechanisms and ensure data is encrypted during transmission.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement basic CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Secure Authentication:** Implement secure authentication flows using Supabase Auth, utilizing protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign specific roles to users within Supabase to control their access levels and permissions within the application.

### Vulnerability Management

- **Code Scanning:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into the CI pipeline to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Accessibility

### Best Practices
- **ARIA Labels:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation, providing a seamless experience for users who rely on keyboard inputs.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Design components to be compatible with screen readers, providing descriptive labels and instructions for visually impaired users.

### Testing
- **Accessibility Testing:** Incorporate accessibility testing into the development workflow using tools like Axe or Lighthouse to identify and fix accessibility issues.
