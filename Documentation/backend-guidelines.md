# Backend Development Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the streamlined coding standards, best practices, and architectural guidelines for developing the backend of the AI-Based Automated Invoice Processing Workflow using FastAPI and Supabase. Adhering to these guidelines ensures the creation of a maintainable, efficient, and secure internal application.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python-based)
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Database & Authentication:** Supabase
- **Data Processing:** pandas, fuzzywuzzy
- **Machine Learning:** OpenAI GPT-4
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2
- **Version Control:** Git

## Coding Standards

### General Practices
- **Pythonic Code:** Write clean and readable Python code following PEP 8 standards.
- **Type Annotations:** Use type hints to enhance code clarity and facilitate error detection.
- **Modular Code:** Organize code into modules and packages based on functionality for better maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Use docstrings to document modules, classes, and functions, providing clear explanations of their purpose and usage.

### Tools
- **Linting:** Use pylint or flake8 to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
- **Formatting:** Utilize Black for consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- **Dependency Management:** Use `pipenv` or `poetry` for managing dependencies and virtual environments.

## Architecture

│ └── init.py 
├── tests/ 
│ ├── unit/ 
│ └── integration/ 
├── requirements.txt 
├── Dockerfile 
├── docker-compose.yml 
└── README.md


### Component Design
- **Endpoints:** Define clear and RESTful API endpoints for functionalities like file uploads, downloads, and authentication.
- **Services:** Encapsulate business logic within service modules to keep endpoints clean and focused on request handling.
- **Models:** Use ORM models to represent and interact with database entities.
- **Utilities:** Implement utility functions for common tasks to promote code reuse and reduce duplication.

## Supabase Integration

### Database Management
- **Schema Design:** Design a simple and scalable database schema using Supabase’s PostgreSQL. Include tables for users, invoices, and file references.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Implement RLS policies to enforce fine-grained access control, ensuring users can only access their own data.
- **Migrations:** Use Supabase’s migration tools to manage database schema changes systematically.

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth:** Utilize Supabase Auth for managing user authentication and authorization. Implement secure authentication flows, including sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Token Management:** Ensure JWT tokens are securely handled and validated on the backend to protect API endpoints.

### Storage
- **Supabase Storage:** Use Supabase Storage for storing uploaded and processed invoice files. Organize storage buckets logically, categorizing files by client and date.
- **Access Control:** Configure storage policies to ensure only authorized users can upload, download, or modify files.

## API Design

### RESTful Principles
- **Resource-Based:** Design APIs around resources (e.g., invoices, users) and use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for actions.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent naming conventions and response structures across all endpoints.
- **Versioning:** Implement API versioning to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.

### Error Handling
- **Standard Responses:** Use standardized error responses with clear messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Logging:** Log all errors with sufficient context to facilitate troubleshooting and debugging without exposing sensitive information.

## Security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption:** Ensure all data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS. Use Supabase’s encryption features for data at rest.
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like Supabase API keys and OpenAI credentials securely using environment variables. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.
- **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls using Supabase’s RLS and storage policies to protect data integrity and privacy.

### Best Practices
- **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to protect against abuse and ensure service availability.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks.

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Data Processing
- **Batch Processing:** Process data in batches where possible to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Use asynchronous programming with FastAPI to handle multiple requests concurrently, enhancing responsiveness.

### Resource Management
- **Scalability:** Design the backend to scale horizontally by adding more instances as needed to handle increased load.
- **Caching:** Implement basic caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **Framework:** Use pytest for writing and running unit tests.
- **Coverage:** Aim for comprehensive test coverage of critical functionalities, including data processing and API endpoints.
- **Mocking:** Use mocking to isolate tests from external dependencies like Supabase and OpenAI APIs.

### Integration Testing
- **Test Environment:** Set up a separate testing environment with its own Supabase project to conduct integration tests without affecting production data.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Ensure that all components work together seamlessly by testing complete workflows, such as file upload, processing, and download.

### Continuous Integration
- **CI Pipeline:** Integrate tests into the CI pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on code commits and pull requests.
- **Reporting:** Provide clear and actionable test reports to facilitate quick identification and resolution of issues.

## Deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- **AWS EC2:** Deploy the backend application on AWS EC2 instances, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Docker:** Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **CI/CD:** Implement Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

### Environment Management
- **Configuration:** Manage environment-specific configurations using environment variables. Ensure that production credentials are securely stored and accessed.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch and Supabase’s built-in tools to track application performance and health.

## Maintenance

### Documentation
- **API Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to facilitate onboarding and collaboration.
- **Technical Docs:** Keep technical documentation concise and relevant, covering key architectural decisions, service integrations, and deployment processes.
- **Change Logs:** Maintain a changelog to track significant changes, updates, and feature additions to the backend codebase.

### Dependency Management
- **Updates:** Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches and performance improvements.
- **Audits:** Use tools like `pip-audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Error Handling

### Detection
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the application for errors and performance issues using AWS CloudWatch and Supabase’s logging features.
- **Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical issues to enable prompt responses and minimize downtime.

### Reporting
- **Logging:** Log all errors with detailed context to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.
- **User Feedback:** Provide meaningful error messages to users without exposing sensitive system details.

### Recovery
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry logic for transient errors, such as network issues or temporary service outages.
- **Fallback Procedures:** Design fallback procedures to handle critical failures gracefully, ensuring that the application remains usable.
